Tweet: @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER @USER That's not what I said. The vast majority of US leftists support gun control. But it's not inherently a left wing policy. Many revolutionary socialists and anarchists don't support aggressive gun control because they believe the working class should be armed for self-defense.
